    <string name="first_run_alert">You are about to set up Shelter.\n\nThis app depends on the <b>Work Profile</b> feature of Android to isolate the apps. If you use a vendor / custom ROM that breaks related features (e.g. MIUI), you should now <b>QUIT</b> and <b>DO NOT</b> use this app.\n\nIf you choose to continue, Shelter will set up Work Profile for you.\n\nIf you are a developer and would like to make Shelter work on those incompatible ROMs like MIUI, pull requests are always welcome. The developer takes <b>ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSIBILITY</b> if you break your device running an incompatible ROM.</string>
