- Start of in-repo changelogs
- Add support for Android 11 (c147377, 3852bd, and more) (__Note__: For now, File Shuttle is not available in the version on Google Play due to policy reasons, as they will not be allowing apps with All Files permission before 2021.)
- Shelter can no longer be installed to external storage (removable SD cards) (9a6777 by Camilio Alejo)
- Allow more browsable intents to be passed across work / main profile boundary (43444b by Camilio Alejo)
- A new shortcut to Documents UI is available in the three-dot menu of Shelter, because on Pixels the Google Files app may not be able to open File Shuttle correctly (a121ee)
